# password-based-circuit-breaker
Password Based Circuit Breaker is a simple project that helps in controlling the electrical lines with the help of a password.   Nowadays, electrical accidents to the line man are increasing, while repairing the electrical lines due to the lack of communication between the electrical substation and maintenance staff. This project gives a solution to this problem to ensure line man safety. In this proposed system, the control (ON/OFF) of the electrical lines lies with line man. This project is arranged in such a way that maintenance staff or line man has to enter the password to ON/OFF the electrical line.
